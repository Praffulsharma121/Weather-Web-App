# Weather-Web-App

A simple weather app built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

# Inspiration

I wanted to lear about APIs, how to fetch them how 'then' work what are promisses. I wanted to try and see how hard would it be to implement a basic Weather web app.

# API

Weather data is retrieved from http://openweathermap.org/
Note:- The weather data retrived from Open Weather is not very accurate. Most of the time, the weather forecast is not correct.

# About
* It is a basic weather application on the top of the screen there is a search option where you can search your city.
* Weather current varies according to location. For example, if the weather forecast shows it raining, there will be a raining GIF in the background.
* The app also shows the weather icons.
